The opposition keep standing with their argument that we can learn from the past, from the previous leader. 

BUT THIS IS NOT ALWAYS RELEVANT AS THE TIME GOES BY

Agree that learning from history is crucial, but stress that nostalgia often leads to selective memory and romanticization of the past. It's important to approach history with a critical and objective perspective to make informed decisions.

Nostalgia can lead to an idealized view of historical periods, which may not accurately represent the complexities and issues of those times. This can lead to misguided policies or decisions.

WHAT : Nostalgia often focuses on the past, diverting attention from addressing pressing current problems and challenges. Emphasize how it hinders progress by clinging to the past.

CULTURAL IDENTITY :

While it's important to preserve cultural identity, relying solely on nostalgia can hinder cultural evolution and adaptation to the modern world. Emphasize the value of balancing tradition with progress to ensure cultural vibrancy and relevance.

Unity and National Pride: Acknowledge the importance of unity and national pride but argue that overemphasizing nostalgia can sometimes lead to exclusion or division, as not everyone may share the same nostalgic sentiments. Encourage a focus on  values that unite people in the present.
