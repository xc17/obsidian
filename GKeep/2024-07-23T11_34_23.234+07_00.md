When I first heard that I won the 3rd rank for the best team in the NSDC, i feel great. Sure, it's not the first rank, I don't even get into the top ten best speakers of the competition. But at that moment I felt great joy, something so big, felt like I won a great war. But, looking back, 2 months later. No I don't feel so great about it, watching the person that beat me in the last round of it, standing up upon the national stage of the competition. No man can lie to oneself about having a jealousy over this. I felt sorrow, especially because my dumb dumb dickhead mf nsdc partner always sent me pictures of my rival participating in national stage of nsdc (i hate her)
