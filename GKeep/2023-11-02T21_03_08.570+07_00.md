I think cultural identity shouldn't be a problem as cultural exchange between Asian artists and Western Industries brings sets of benefits to asian artists.

The cultural exchange between these two makes the art more well received in both sides because it contains both cultural value. For example, the K-POP industry's popularity promotes Asian culture and led to surge in interest in asian tradition, language and fashion.

Collaborating with Western markets can open up significant economic opportunities for Asian artists. BTS, a South Korean boy band, is a prime example. They've achieved immense success globally, contributing to South Korea's economy and showcasing the potential for Asian artists in the Western market.

The governments argument stated that each of cultural style is unique and different from each other. But why is this bad? Not that it's even better if multicultural product are procured to entertain wider audience so it can be globally received and appreciated.

Cultural Isolation: A lack of engagement with Western industries might lead to cultural isolation, limiting the cross-cultural exchanges that can foster mutual understanding and appreciation.

Deputy Government said that western industries affect asian films badly but if there were no films promoting asian culture there could be some fatal issue happening.

Asian artists, like any other artists, should have the freedom to choose their creative direction. 

Ultimately, the decision of whether to pander to Western industries or not should be up to the artists themselves. Some Asian artists may choose to focus primarily on their home markets, while others may seek global recognition.
