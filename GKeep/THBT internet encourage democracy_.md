Government Side

ASSERTION:

In recent worlds, it isn't necessary for people to come in face-to-face in a rally to urge democracy. Other media that are widely used for all kinds of things including democratic activities are no other than the Internet. Our side of the house believe that internet does encourage democracy. Internet is a vast universe. One can promote and encourage others through their screens, and voice out their opinion safely.

REASONS:

I have two arguments that will back up my position.
Going into my first argument :

> Wide information access and transparency
Internet with their (...) provides a limitless access of information about just everything we know and will know. This could also ensure the transparency of political actions that took place, minimizing the skeptical view of their citizens over one-sided policies etc.

> Participation & engagement platform availability 
Internet facilitate it's users with the ability to participate and engage in democratic movements or political actions anywhere, anytime. Internet also make it easier for people to voice out their opinion with easily accessible online platform(s).

(if such movement or action takes place,...)
> Can internet organize a political movement?
Yes it can. Obviously. Just take for example the Black Lives Matters or the Save Palestine movements. Many of it started with the internet. They gain information and encourage others to participate then organize the actions through online platforms. Well, that are examples of internet organizing a political movements, what about more generalized examples?

EXAMPLES:

Other examples could be:
- Online petition platforms 
Sites like change.org could invite and urge other people to engage in activities that provides positive impact on others like open donation etc.

LINK-BACK:

The internet, through it's capacity to give access to information, provide a platform for people or citizens to participate in, ensuring transparency and mobilizing political actions plays a pivotal role in preserving the democratic values of a nation. These is why we believe that internet encourage democracy.
