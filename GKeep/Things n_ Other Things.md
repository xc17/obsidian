Things n’ Other Things
Ihsan Fashbir Danurrahardjo
Feb 7 2024, 22:59

Long the swan still avast midst the rogue of time
Shun ‘nder moon’s very mirror 
Dead dead dog, the lake is to—
And long the wait of doom doth last

Cold mirror, colder than the heart
Grip the veins whom dare seek o’
Lest the sun seeth below thy lake
Embody sleek of two things to—

Sight a ditto of the He
Criple, shed a rain over the Asters
One o’… he has reach the things
That of thriumps of minds over matters

Lost the night lo seek for sun’s awe
Lost the minds o’ veil I feel
Blind he is thicker than the womb
O’ Lost he is deeper than the sands
