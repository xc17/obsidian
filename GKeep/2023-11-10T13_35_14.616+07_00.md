HYPOTHESIS : 
Let's say, there is 40 students in a class. And the students will get to borrow the same book from the library, and they will return it all at the same time.

Option 1 : Each student gets to borrow a book individually. Each student get one book. And when the times come, they all will return it at the same time. So the total of books borrowed is 40.

Option 2 : Each student will get paired with another student. So there will be 20 pair of students. Each pair of students get one book so the total books borrowed is 20.

My hypothesis suggests that, with option one, the chance (percentage) of a student not returning the book, is higher than if we choose option two consider each student is different in gender, personality, and discipline.

CHATGPT RESPONSE :
Your hypothesis raises an interesting point. In a classroom of 40 students, if we assume that each student has an equal chance of not returning the book, then Option 1 (where each student borrows a book individually) indeed presents a higher risk of a student not returning the book compared to Option 2 (where students are paired up and borrow a book as a pair).

In Option 1, with 40 individual books borrowed, any individual student not returning the book would result in a higher overall impact. In contrast, in Option 2, with 20 pairs of students sharing books, the impact of one student not returning the book is less significant because it affects a pair, not an individual.

However, it's important to consider that other factors like the students' sense of responsibility, discipline, and the specific circumstances can also influence whether they return the books. While your hypothesis makes sense in theory, real-life outcomes might vary based on these factors.

In my opinion, both options have their advantages and disadvantages. Option 1 allows each student to have their own book, which can be more convenient for individual study. Option 2 promotes sharing and cooperation but might have some logistical challenges. Ultimately, the success of either option would depend on the students' behavior and the management of the borrowing process.
